This is a Symfony 3 bundle containing Doctrine 2 generated entities for the EVE Online static information database. 
The original static information is available at: https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources.
The entities are generated based on the Mysql conversion provided at https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ (special thanks to Steve Ronuken - in game name).
